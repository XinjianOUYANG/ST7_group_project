# ST7 project: Facial Expression Recognition

We try to reproduce the work [Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/amilkh/cs230-fer) of Amilkh's Group.

## Overview

Folder [ST7_model](https://github.com/XinjianOUYANG/ST7_group_project/tree/master/ST7_models) includes the models we have built and pretrained

## Presentation
on Thursday morning (the 8th of April), 10h15 - 10h35 : group 4

    watching your classmates' project solutions are part of the class (so a 2 hours class)
    
    your presentations should not last more than 15 minutes per group 
    (demonstration included - note that the demonstration(s) can be at the beginning or during the presentation, not especially in the end ;) 
    + you can record it before !)
    
    5 minutes are dedicated to questions (from your classmates and teachers)
    
    when possible (for instance, for groups that use some machine learning tools), 
    say a few words regarding optimisation (link with the optimisation course).

In addition, write a report (maximum 10 pages) about our project, to be sent to Simon Leglaive before Sunday, April 11 23:59.
